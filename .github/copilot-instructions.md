# Project Overview

This project is a portfolio website built using SvelteKit and Typescript. The website is designed to showcase various projects. It includes a home page, about page, and individual project pages. The home page lists all projects with links to their own respective pages. 

## Folder Structure

- `/src/content`: Contains the markdown files which are supposed to be rendered as pages.
- `/src/routes`: Contains the Svelte files which define the routes for the application.

## Libraries and Frameworks

- Typescript, Svelte5 , Sveltekit and modern CSS for the frontend

## Coding Standards

- Create UI elements using semantic HTML following CSS styles in `styles.css`.
- Use Svelte components to encapsulate functionality and UI elements.
- Use Typescript for type safety and better code quality.
- Ensure all pages are responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Use markdown files in `/src/content` for content management.
- Ensure proper error handling and loading states for asynchronous operations.
- Follow best practices for accessibility (e.g., proper use of ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).
- Ensure code is modular and reusable where possible.
- Avoid code duplication by creating reusable components.
- Use comments to explain complex logic and code sections.
- Follow a consistent naming convention for files and variables.
<!-- - Ensure all external links open in a new tab and have appropriate `rel` attributes for security.
- Create storybook stories for all components. -->
- Use Git for version control and follow a branching strategy for feature development and bug fixes.
- CSS should be in a style.css file where possible and not inline styles in a Javascript file.
- Make sure the correct syantax is used for Typescript, Svelte and CSS.
- Follow good coding practices and ensure the code is clean and well-documented.

## UI guidelines

- Keep layout simple and user-friendly,
- Site should have a modern and clean design following `styles.css`
- Use a consistent color scheme and typography throughout the site
- Ensure good contrast between text and background for readability
- Use whitespace effectively to create a balanced and uncluttered layout
- Use high-quality images and optimize them for web use
- Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links) have appropriate hover and focus states
- Ensure the site is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation)
- Test the site on different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness
- Use animations and transitions sparingly to enhance user experience without overwhelming the user
- Use consistent iconography and imagery that aligns with the overall design aesthetic
- Ensure the site follows best practices for SEO (e.g., proper use of meta tags, headings, alt attributes for images)
- Ensure the site is easy to navigate with a clear and intuitive menu structure
- Use a grid system to create a consistent layout across different pages
- Ensure all text is legible and appropriately sized for different screen sizes
